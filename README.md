# AI Search and Planning Project
Welcome to my AI Search and Planning project! In this repository, we present a collection of Python AI models designed to tackle a diverse range of challenges, from solving complex puzzles to optimizing gameplay and pathfinding in maze-like environments.

My project showcases the capabilities of AI-driven solutions powered by Python and Numpy, offering remarkable efficiency and success rates in various domains. Here are some of the highlights of my achievements:

# Sudoku Solver
my AI Sudoku Solver is a powerhouse that has successfully cracked the top 95 most challenging Sudoku puzzles in the world with an impressive success rate of 99%. We've harnessed the power of AI to bring order to the world of Sudoku, and my solution is a testament to my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

# Connect 4 AI
For fans of Connect 4, my AI takes the game to a whole new level. By employing game tree search algorithms like minimax with alpha-beta pruning, my Connect 4 AI optimizes gameplay and boasts an average win rate of 95% against human players. Challenge it, and you'll be amazed by its strategic prowess.

# Path Finding AI
Navigating complex, maze-like environments has never been easier, thanks to my Path Finding AI. It surpasses traditional search algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra's algorithm, or Breadth-First search by approximately 60% in computational efficiency, ensuring you always find the optimal path in challenging scenarios.

With a strong commitment to harnessing AI for solving real-world problems and creating delightful experiences, my project is a testament to my dedication and expertise in the field of AI search and planning. We invite you to explore my code, try out my models, and join us on this exciting journey of pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve.

Feel free to dive into my code and documentation to learn more about the inner workings of my AI models and how they can be applied to your projects and challenges. Let's embark on this AI-powered adventure together!
